                    <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
                    <p>At Rig Rater, we believe in complete transparency with our readers. We want you to understand how we make money and how that might affect the content, topics, posts, and reviews published on this website.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
                    <p>This website contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links and subsequently make a purchase, we will receive a small commission. This commission comes at no extra cost to you but helps us keep this site running and allows us to continue producing honest and helpful content.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Our Review Process</h2>
                    <p>It's important to note that our affiliate relationships do NOT influence our product reviews or recommendations. Our editorial team maintains complete independence from our business operations:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>We never accept payment for positive reviews</li>
                        <li>We test all products thoroughly before making recommendations</li>
                        <li>We highlight both pros and cons of each product</li>
                        <li>Our recommendations are based on objective testing and real-world usage</li>
                        <li>We often recommend products from companies with whom we have no affiliate relationship</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Affiliate Partners</h2>
                    <p>We currently have affiliate relationships with several retailers and manufacturers, including but not limited to:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amazon</li>
                        <li>Newegg</li>
                        <li>Best Buy</li>
                        <li>B&H Photo</li>
                        <li>Micro Center</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Identifying Affiliate Links</h2>
                    <p>Affiliate links on our site are primarily found in the following locations:</p>

                        <li>Product recommendation cards on our homepage and review listings</li>
                        <li>Comparison tables when multiple products are featured</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>All "Buy Now" and "Check Price" buttons on our site are affiliate links unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Our Promise to You</h2>
                    <p>We promise that:</p>
                    
                    <ul>

                        <li>We will never recommend a product solely because of an affiliate commission</li>
                        <li>We will prioritize reader trust over short-term gains</li>
                        <li>Our reviews will remain honest, thorough, and unbiased</li>
                    </ul>
