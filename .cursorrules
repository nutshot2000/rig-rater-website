      The homepage (index.html) should feature:
      1. A Swiper.js carousel for the top 6 latest/featured reviews.
         - Carousel should be configured with centeredSlides: true and loop.
         - Swiper CSS/JS should be included.
      2. A static grid of review cards below the carousel for the next 6 reviews.
      3. Any reviews beyond these 12 should only appear on the main reviews.html page.
  
  image_galleries:
    library: "Swiper.js"
    description: |
      For product review pages (e.g., *-review.html), if multiple images are available
      for a product, they should be presented in a Swiper.js image gallery.
      - Gallery should allow users to slide/click through images.
      - Include navigation arrows and pagination dots.
      - The gallery container should be constrained in width (e.g., max-width: 500px) and centered.
      - Example implementation: asus-rog-maximus-z890-apex-review.html product gallery.
