                    </ul>

                    <h3>Ray Tracing Performance</h3>
                    <p>Ray tracing is where Nvidia typically excels, but the B580 holds its own for a budget GPU. It's 55% faster than the RX 7600 at 1080p but 20% slower than the RTX 4060. At 1440p, it's 18% slower than the RTX 4060 but still competitive. Specific game results include:</p>
                    <ul class="benchmark-list">
                        <li><strong>Metro Exodus Enhanced:</strong> 86 FPS at 1080p (31% slower than RTX 4060), 60 FPS at 1440p (53% faster than RX 7600).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cyberpunk 2077:</strong> 58 FPS at 1080p (14% faster than RTX 4060), 41 FPS at 1440p (60% faster than RTX 4060).</li>
                        <li><strong>Dying Light 2:</strong> 62 FPS at 1080p (11% faster than RTX 4060), 45 FPS at 1440p (18% faster than RTX 4060).</li>
                        <li><strong>Spider-Man Remastered:</strong> 67 FPS at 1080p (20% slower than RTX 4060).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, ray tracing performance falters in some titles. Alan Wake II is nearly unplayable at <30 FPS, and Black Myth: Wukong is 84% slower than the RTX 4060, highlighting areas where Nvidia maintains an edge.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Performance Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>The B580 isn't perfect. In games like Starfield (20% slower than RTX 4060 at 1080p) and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (16% slower than RTX 4060 at 1080p), it underperforms. These are exceptions rather than the rule, but they're worth noting for fans of these titles.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Upscaling and Features: XeSS 2 Shines</h2>
                    <p>Intel's XeSS 2 upscaling technology is a standout feature, boosting frame rates with minimal visual quality loss. Supported in over 150 games, XeSS 2 helps the B580 compete with Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FSR. For example, in F1 24, XeSS 2 significantly enhances performance, though support was limited at launch. The B580 also benefits from resizable BAR (Smart Access Memory), which Intel recommends enabling for optimal performance.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Power Consumption and Cooling: Efficient and Quiet</h2>
                    <p>With a TDP of 190W, the B580 draws more power than the RTX 4060 (115W). Real-world tests show:</p>
                    <ul class="benchmark-list">
                        <li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws:</strong> 22% more power than RTX 4060 (+49W), 8% faster.</li>
                        <li><strong>Starfield:</strong> 16% more power than RTX 4060, 23% slower.</li>
                        <li><strong>Space Marine 2:</strong> 27% more power than RTX 4060 (+56W), 6% faster.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite the higher power draw, the B580 runs cool and quiet. GPU temperatures peak at 62°C, memory at 70°C, with fan speeds between 1,250-1,350 RPM. This makes it an excellent choice for compact builds where thermals are a concern.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Driver Support: Much Improved, But Not Perfect</h2>
                    <p>Intel's first-gen Arc GPUs faced driver issues, but the B580 benefits from significantly improved software. Most modern games run smoothly, and Intel has enhanced compatibility with older titles (e.g., Sleeping Dogs). However, occasional inconsistencies persist, particularly with older or niche games. For instance, some games failed to run at launch, though this is less common than with earlier Arc GPUs (PCWorld).</p>
                    
                    <h2>CPU Compatibility: A Potential Bottleneck</h2>
                    <p>The B580 performs best with modern CPUs like the Ryzen 7 9800X3D or Intel's latest Core series. When paired with older CPUs, such as the Ryzen 5 2600, performance can suffer in CPU-limited scenarios. For example, in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, the B580 dropped to 31 FPS with a Ryzen 5 2600, compared to the RTX 4060's better performance (TechSpot). If you're upgrading an older system, consider your CPU to avoid bottlenecks.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Value for Money: Unbeatable at $249</h2>
                    <p>The B580 offers exceptional value, delivering 27% better cost-per-frame than the RTX 4060 and 24% better than the RX 7600 at 1440p (based on MSRP). Its 12GB VRAM is a major advantage over the 8GB in competing GPUs, ensuring longevity as games demand more memory. Compared to the RTX 4060 Ti ($399, 40% more expensive), the B580 often ties or comes close in performance, making it a smarter buy for most gamers.</p>

                        </tbody>
                    </table>

                    <h2>Availability and Market Context</h2>
                    <p>The B580 launched to strong demand, with pre-sales selling out quickly due to its compelling price and 12GB VRAM (TechSpot). As of May 2025, supplies have likely stabilized, though competition from Nvidia's RTX 50 series and AMD's RX 8000 series, rumored to have launched earlier this year, may have shifted the market (PC Guide). Without specific May 2025 reviews, the B580's value proposition remains strong, but newer GPUs may offer additional options.</p>
