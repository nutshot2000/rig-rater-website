Create a complete tech reviews website inspired by PC Gamer (https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/), with a focus on prominent, boxy cards and a modern, polished design. The site must use only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with no frameworks like React or Bootstrap. Include the following files: index.html, reviews.html, contact.html, budget-gpu-2025.html, affiliate-disclosure.html, styles.css, script.js, and .cursorrules. 

**Requirements**:
1. **Structure**:
   - **index.html**: Homepage with a header (logo and navigation: Home, Reviews, Contact), a grid of boxy cards for articles (e.g., "Best Budget GPU for 2025," "Best Motherboard at Each Price Point"), and a footer with an affiliate disclosure link.
   - **reviews.html**: Similar to index.html, listing all review articles in a card grid.
   - **contact.html**: Contact form (name, email, message) with the same header and footer.
   - **budget-gpu-2025.html**: Article page with a title, image, text, and affiliate links for GPUs.
   - **affiliate-disclosure.html**: Page explaining affiliate links, styled consistently.
   - **styles.css**: All styling, using Roboto font (via Google Fonts), a dark theme, and PC Gamer-inspired colors (e.g., blue #00aaff).
   - **script.js**: Handle contact form submission (alert "Message sent!" and clear form) and log affiliate link clicks for analytics.
   - **.cursorrules**: Enforce HTML, CSS, JavaScript only, boxy card design, and no complex features.

2. **Design**:
   - **Boxy Cards**: Prominent, 3D-like cards with deep shadows (8px+), rounded corners (12px), and a hover lift (translateY -10px). Each card has an image (300x220px), title, description, and a "Buy Now" affiliate link button.
   - **Styling**: Dark background (#1e1e1e), gradient header (#1a1a1a to #2a2a2a), bold blue accents (#00aaff), large headings (36px for h1, 24px for h2), and ample padding (40px grid, 30px articles). Use shadows and transitions for a premium feel.
   - **Responsive**: Cards scale in a grid (min 320px width), with clean mobile stacking.
   - **Buttons**: Vibrant "Buy Now" buttons (blue, rounded, hover effect) and a matching contact form button.

3. **Features**:
   - **Affiliate Links**: Include in cards and articles (e.g., Amazon, Newegg placeholders), opening in new tabs. Add a footer disclosure: "We may earn an affiliate commission from links on our site. Learn more."
   - **No Newsfeed**: Focus on a static card grid, no scrolling feed.
   - **Content**: Placeholder text for articles, editable for reviews (e.g., GPU features, pros/cons).

4. **Constraints**:
   - Keep it simple, avoiding backend logic or unnecessary files.
   - Use .cursorrules to enforce boxy, PC Gamer-inspired design and prevent frameworks.
   - Ensure all files are consistent in style and structure.

Generate all files with clean, commented code, ready to preview in a browser. Include placeholder images (e.g., via.placeholder.com) and affiliate links (e.g., amazon.com/placeholder?tag=youraffiliateid-20).
